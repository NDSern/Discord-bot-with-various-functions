# Various-functions-Discord-bot
A Discord bot that is made to (mostly)post Leetcode Daily Challenge, and other various personal functions.
This bot is created with the purpose of motivate me and my friends to do Leetcode challenges, which help us to get better at programming. It also has some other functions that I added so it would be more convenient to communicate with each other, or eliminate the need of openning the web browser while using the phone(we always have Discord open on the phone)

## Functions:
- Automatically post Leetcode daily challenge in a channel.
- Translate documents or texts to English(Auto detect language and translate it using DeepL).
- Some other smaller functions.

## Commands:
- **/translate** <Text>
Translate following text to English
- **/leetsubscribe**
Subscribe a channel to the daily posting of Leetcode challenges
- **/leetd**
Make the bot post the current Leetcode challenge
- **/leetnewd**
Sometimes, Leetcode update their daily challenges slower than usual so the **/leetsubscribe** command took the previous day challenge, so this comment will try to get the new Leetcode daily challenge.

## How to run the bot
- Create a .env file and use your own credentials for the bot to run. Additionally, create a free DeepL API key and the bot can translate too.
- Run the 'bot.py' file.
